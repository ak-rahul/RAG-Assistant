# Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Overview

## Introduction
Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to computer systems that can perform tasks 
requiring human intelligence. Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI focused 
on learning from data.

## Key Concepts

### Machine Learning Types
1. Supervised Learning - Learning from labeled data
2. Unsupervised Learning - Finding patterns in unlabeled data
3. Reinforcement Learning - Learning through trial and error

### Applications
- Natural Language Processing (NLP): Text understanding and generation
- Computer Vision: Image and video analysis
- Recommendation Systems: Personalized suggestions
- Autonomous Systems: Self-driving cars, robots

## RAG Systems
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines:
- Information retrieval from knowledge bases
- Text generation using large language models
- Results in more accurate, grounded responses

## Future Trends
AI is evolving rapidly with advances in:
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Multimodal AI (text, image, audio)
- Efficient model architectures
- Ethical AI development
